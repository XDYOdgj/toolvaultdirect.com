I figured I\u2019d wait until next Spring and Summer to plant something else. I didn\u2019t think the empty planters looked \u201cbad\u201d necessarily, but when I saw these green, artificial, low maintenance topiary bushes, I figured it would be a nice, low maintenance way to make the backyard look a little nicer without having to do any major planting or landscaping. I cannot believe how big of a difference it made! Just adding these two faux topiaries took my backyard from sad and depressing to \u201clooks like I actually tried\u201d. ?? I am actually a huge fan of the shaped greenery or \u201ctopiary\u201d look so these were perfect for me. I think that topiaries give any yard a bit more of a sophisticated English garden vibe that just subconsciously looks high end- even if they are faux. The best part was that there was no actual digging or planting to do. I cannot stand landscaping and it is freezing cold outside so there\u2019s zero chance I was going to get out there and start planting in the cold dirt. These topiaries simply had to be fluffed a bit to give them the rounded shape and then you attach them to the metal \u201cstake\u201d at the bottom with a sharp pointed end. You can just stab that into the dirt and the entire topiary will stay put. It took me less than 5 minutes to take my backyard from sad and depressing to English garden vibes. These topiaries are well worth the money and can be reused for years to come. It\u2019s nice to have an option like this in your garage in lieu of buying plants constantly and trying to have a green thumb. I can see myself buying some faux plants like this to add to my front yard plant beds to trick all the neighbors into thinking I\u2019m fancy.These topiaries are perfect to put at the entrance to your home, outside in the backyard, in planters in the ground, or in a planter by the garage. You could also use these as indoor plants- I think they\u2019d look cool in a kitchen above the cabinets. 5 stars!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-11 18:36:13"},{"user":"Tammy Wilson","content":"These are wonderful!When you unpack them, you'll have a little shaping that you'll have to do.I found that initially holding them upright (like an ice cream cone) and shaking vigorously up and down helps get things started - then twisting/spinning back and forth by the trunk, to let centrifugal force help pull things out.From there, a little fine adjusting to spread things out and fill any gaps.I didn't want a \"perfect\" spehere, so I got it somewhat close... I figure its a little more convincing if its not perfect.Then I just plopped each one into a pot and was done.If you wanted a near-perfect sphere, I think you could get it if you spend some time on it.During the process, I didn't lose any branches or leaves, which is truly a testament to the quality of the product.In my opinion, these look very realistic, even up close.I think they're beautiful and really hope they will hold up to the harsh summers we endure where I live.I think they'll outlast the real thing in my climate, and they're pretty enough that I'd even be willing to replace every couple years if necessary, as these really aren't much more expensive than replacing a real one.I think these make a great substitute for the real thing in cases where you're in the wrong zone or just don't have the time/talent to maintain the real plant.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-24 18:36:13"},{"user":"BeautyQueen10","content":"I am very pleased with this set of two boxwood ball bushes. I noticed right away how full the leaves are, and the slight variation in the green gives them a more realistic appearance. I found it easy to fluff up the leaves without any fallout. The package comes with stakes and spikes that attach to the base of the bushes.If you're like me and struggle to grow certain plants due to poor soil or the effort required for digging, these are an excellent solution. I placed both bushes in my backyard landscaping after removing some real boxwood plants that wouldn't thrive. I have to say, they look incredible and very lifelike! They added a nice pop of green, and when my solar spotlights shine on them, they look amazing! The quality and sturdiness are evident as soon as you take them out of the package and set them up. The stakes are very durable and can be placed in even the hardest soil. Just be cautious, as the bottom spike is sharp. I accidentally placed it on a patio bean bag, and it made a hole\u2014totally my fault, but those spikes are indeed sharp!This is an awesome product and a worthwhile purchase! No water, no problems.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-03 18:36:13"},{"user":"Sage P","content":"OMG, these are super cute.These artificial boxwood topiary balls are a fantastic addition to any outdoor space. They have a natural, full look and hold up well in various weather conditions. The included ground spikes make installation easy and keep them securely in place. A perfect low-maintenance way to add greenery to your garden, patio, or walkway!It came wit ha extra ground spike.They come in the a box a little flat on one side but with a little movement of branches they look round and full.I absolutely love these and look super nice out of the box.I will update the picture one I get a nice outdoor pot to add them too.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-04 18:36:13"},{"user":"Jennifer Howard","content":"Both topiaries are the same, very full. They look realistic and are made to be outdoors. After unboxing, the only assembly was simply adjust the leaves and place in the stake. I did have a little trouble keeping the stake in but I did eventually get it. I did try them in a planter without using the stake and it was fine just make sure to have something to hold them in the planter if you go this way. However, these came with stakes and I love the ease of just putting them in the ground. I could easily put these next to real plants and they would blend in. Coloring wise, there are various shades of green whichmakes these look realistic and beautiful!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-01 18:36:13"},{"user":"Guy32 Wife28","content":"These came in a box little squashed but they can be easily bent into position and fluffed up. I poked one of them in the front porch planter just for fun to see how it looks and already got my first compliment on it so I'm happy. I can't speak about durability yet because its winter now and in summer the sun is the sharpest and bleaches everything. I will not be putting these on a direct sunlight however because that would bleach anything so it wouldn't be fair. From close yes you can tell these bushes are not real but nobody comes that close to our porch so i'm fine with that. Overall they look very pretty and seem to be well made","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-30 18:36:13"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"With a little \"fluffing,\" these boxwood topiaries are full and beautiful.I ordered them to keep in planters on the porch at our rental house.Since I'm not there all the time, it was impossible to keep live plants looking good, but these boxwoods provide a beautiful welcoming entrance to the front porch.They are realistic looking and since the porch gets a little direct sunlight every day, I particularly appreciate the UV resistance.Since I just put these out, I can't speak to how long they will continue to look good, but I am hoping to get long term use out of them for the price point.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-04 18:36:13"},{"user":"Kyann","content":"These artificial boxwood plants are really nice and look very real.I wanted them for two planters that I have on my front porch.In the spring, I'm always changing flowers in the pots, and it can get pretty pricey, so I thought that these would work nicely as a replacement for real flowers.They come with a hard plastic dial and a plant stake to insert into the planter dirt.Very easy to use.I would definitely recommend.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-04 18:36:13"},{"user":"SciTeacher","content":"These are just what I needed for my sunny hot porch. The way my porch sits, the temperature can get pretty intense - plants there sometimes need to be watered multiple times per day. These will provide some greenery without the constant attention. They are full and relatively realistic. It didn\u2019t take much to fluff them out.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-05 18:36:13"}];
